To compile you need to do the following:

export $MACHTYPE
make

The makefile should detect the architecture based on the MACHTYPE environment variable. If it fails then
do an echo $MACHTYPE to see what it is set to. If it is not set then you may have to set it manually
to arm, i386 or x86_64 and export it.

The makefile automatically copys a default tnc.ram from the binary_dumps directory. This is an initial
ram image for the tnc with a lot of the tnc's configuration options preset. You will need to set mycall
to you callsign by issuing the command "mycall callsign". Once that is set hit ctrl-c to exit the
program and it will save the ram config with your call. If you want to start fresh like a real cold
boot delete the file tnc.ram and the tnc will come up in autobaud. You will need to press the *
several times for it to detect the baudrate. Of course this is fake since there is no baud rate to
the console but that is how the original tnc works and since we emulate the serial ports its expected.
When you get the prompt then the tnc will be set to the default values. A lot of the config options
don't matter since this is an emulator but you can set any of them as if this was a true tnc. Refer
to the hk-21 manual for what the settings are, or most tnc manuals since a lot of the commands are
standard. You can use "disp" to see the current settings of the tnc.
