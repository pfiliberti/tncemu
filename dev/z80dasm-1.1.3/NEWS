z80dasm 1.1.3
=============

	Target addresses of relative branches weren't properly wrapped
	around the boundaries of 16-bit address space, resulting in missing
	labels for such branches and stack corruption due to a buffer
	overflow on 64-bit architectures.

	Thanks to Eric Smith for reporting this bug and providing a patch.

z80dasm 1.1.2
=============

	Added missing files to the tar file.

z80dasm 1.1.1
=============

	Fixed bug in label creation: a label was created for every 0xdd 
	command.

z80dasm 1.1.0
=============

	Rewritten symbol table routines. Support for input symbol files
	('-S' option). Removed unnecessary and badly documented '-r'
	option. Better comments in the output symbol file regarding where
	in the assembly source a particular symbol is used.

	Support for spliting binary file into data and code blocks.

	Automatic labels that are first seen in a "call" instruction are
	named "sub_XXXXh" instead of "lXXXXh".

z80dasm 1.0.1
=============

	Various Debian package related changes.

	Unprintable characters are replaced by ASCII dot when using '-t'
	option (similar to hexdump).

	Some minor bug fixes.

Summary of changes from dz80 3.0 to z80dasm 1.0.0
=================================================

dz80dat.c:
	Fixed table entry for "2c" opcode (inc l).

dz80.c:
	Added undocumented instruction "sli" ("cb 30") to the opcode decoding 
	logic.  

	Replaced command-line handling code with calls to code in cmdline.c.

	Made Zilog-assembler compatiblity mode run-time configurable.

	Fixed incorrect handling of sign bit for offsets for relative jumps
	("jr" and "djnz" instructions)

	Fixed handling of unknown or partial opcodes (these are now included
	in the output with "defb" assembler directives)

	New function for error reporting in cmdline.c

	Disassembler output from pass 1 and 2 redirected from standard output 
	to temporary files.
