				    z80dasm 
				    =======

Disassembler for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor and compatibles. It can be
used to reverse engineer programs and operating systems for 1980's
microcomputers using this processor architecture (for example Sinclar ZX80,
ZX81, Spectrum, Galaksija and others).

Generated assembly code can be assembled back with any of the following:

zasm   - Z80 assembler by GÃ¼nter Woigk
z80asm - Available at http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/z80asm/

or the original Zilog Z80 assembler.

z80dasm is based largely on dz80 3.0, written by Jan Panteltje (available
at http://panteltje.com/panteltje/z80/index.html). z80dasm was extensively 
tested, a lot of bugs were fixed and a more UNIX-like command line interface
was added. See NEWS file for a summary of changes.
