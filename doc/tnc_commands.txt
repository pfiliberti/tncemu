This is a list of commands that the tnc firmware supports.

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    8BITCONV ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    8
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The high-order bit IS NOT stripped in
                    Converse Mode.

               OFF  The high-order bit IS stripped in
                    Converse Mode.

Refer to  :    AWLEN, PARITY, RXBLOCK
------------------------------------------------------------
8BITCONV permits packet transmission of eight-bits  data  in
the converse mode.

If  8BITCONV  is  OFF,  the  high-order  bit  (bit seven) of
character received from the terminal is removed  before  the
characters are transmitted in a packet.

The  standard  ASCII character set requires only seven bits.
The eight or final bit is used as a parity bit or ignored.

NOTE: Setting bit seven in text characters transmitted  over
the air may cause confusion at the other end.

If  you  need  to transmit eight-bit data but don't want all
the features of Transparnt Mode,  set 8BITCONV ON and  AWLEN
8.  This  may  be  desirable if you are using a special non-
ASCII character set.

Since commands require only  the  standard  seven-bit  ASCII
character  set,  bit  seven is always removed in the Command
Mode.

Set this command to ON if you use RXBLOCK.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    3RDPARTY ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    3RD
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Allow any station to access your BBS.

               OFF  Allow to access the BBS only station
                    specified by MYMCALL.

Refer to  :    MBOD, MYMCALL
------------------------------------------------------------
This  command  sets whether any station can be allowed to use
your message board as an open BBS.If 3RDPARTY is OFF, your
message board is effective for only personal use.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    AX25L2V2 ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    A
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The TNc uses AX.25 level 2 version 2.0
                    protocol.

               OFF  The TNc uses AX.25 level 2 version l.0
                    protocol.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
Some   implementations  of  the  earlier  version  of  AX.25
protocol will not repeat version 2.0 AX.25 packets properly.
This command provides compatibility with those older  packet
controllers.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    ABAUD n (0 - 19200)
Mnemonic  :    AB
Default   :    9600

Parameter :    n    Specifies the data rate of signaling
                    speed in baud, on the serial I/O
                    terminal port. The "n" should be 0, 300,
                    600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 19200.

Refer to  :    RESTART, RESET, RAMTEST
------------------------------------------------------------
ABAUD displays the baud rate set by the auto baud routine
when you first apply power to the unit or type RESET.

Use ABAUD to specify a terminal baud rae that will become
active on the next power up or RESTART. A warning message
reminds you of this. 

If you plan to change terminals but want to retain all of
the RAM parameter values, set ABAUD, AWLEN, and PARITY to
the new terminal's characteristics while you are still
connected to the old terminal. Then turn off the TNC, change
to the terminal and turn the TNC on again.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    AUTOLF ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    AU
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   A line feed character <LF> is sent to
                    the terminal after each carriage return
                    character <CR>.

               OFF  A <LF> is NOT sent to the terminal after
                    each <CR>.

Refer to  :    LFADD, RXBLOCK
------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOLF is included  to  maintain  compatibility  with  other
packet radio controllers.

If  your  display  terminal does not line-feed during packet
reception, check this command.

AUTOLF affects only terminal displays and it does not affect
sending packet.

If the other station you are talking to reports overprinting
of packets from your station, use LFADD command.

To use RXBLOCK command, set AUTOLF OFF to accurately display
the data block length.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    AWLEN n
Mnemonic  :    AW
Default   :    7

Parameter :    n    7 or 8 specifies the number of data bits
                    per word.

Refer to  :    8BITCONV, PARITY, RESTART
------------------------------------------------------------
The  parameter value defines the digital word length used by
the serial input/output (IO) terminal port and your computer
or terminal program.   The  new  value  affects  only  after
RESTART or power On/Off reset.

NOTE: Use default value (7) for most packet operations, such
as conversation,  working electronic mail and bulletin board
systems and transmission of ASCII files.

If eight-bit words are sent to the TNC in the Command or the
Converse modes, the eighth bit is normally removed,  leaving
a  standard  ASCII  character,  regardless of the setting of
AWLEN.

All eight data bits of each character must  be  retained  to
send executable files or other special data.

NOTE: Set AWLEN to 8 and use the Transparent Mode.

You  can also use Converse Mode and set AWLEN 8 and 8BITCONV
ON.  However,  you must precede the  Converse  Mode  special
characters with the PASS character in the data you send.

NOTE: Set AWLEN to 8 if you use RXBLOCK command.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    AXDELAY n
Mnemonic  :    AXD
Default   :    0

Parameter :    n    0 - 120 specifies a key-up delay for
                    voice repeater 10mS intervals.

Refer to  :    AXHANG, TXDELAY, DWAIT
------------------------------------------------------------
AXDELAY  specifies  the  period  of time the controller will
wait, in addition to the normal delay set by TXDELAY,  after
keying the transmitter and before data is sent.

Packet  groups  using  a standard "voice" repeater to extend
the range of the local network may need to use this feature.

Repeaters with slow electromechanical relays,  split  sites,
auxiliary links,  or other circuits which delay transmission
for some time after the RF carrier is present,  require some
amount of time to get the RF on the air,

If  you  are  using  a repeater that has not previously been
used for packet operations,  try various values to find  the
best value.

If  other stations have been using the repeater,  check with
them for the proper setting.

AXDELAY acts in conjunction with AXHANG.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    AXHANG n
Mnemonic  :    AXH
Default   :    0

Parameter :    n    0 - 250 specifies voice repeater hang
                    time in 100mS intervals.

Refer to  :    AXDELAY, DWAIT
------------------------------------------------------------
  A numeric value can be used to increase channel efficiency
when an audio repeater has a  hang  time  greater  than  100
milliseconds.  For  a repeater with a long hang time,  it is
not necessary to wait for the repeater  key-up  delay  after
keying he transmitter if the repeater is still transmitting.

When the TNc has heard a packet sent within the hang period,
it  does  not add the repeater key-up delay (AXDELAY) to the
key-up time.   The key-up time is determined  by  TXDELAY  +
DWAIT.  Therefore,  set  AXHANG  should  be  set  less  than
repeater hang time.

If you are using a repeater that hasn't been used for packet
operation before, try various values to find the best value.

If other packet stations have been using the  repeater,  ask
them for the appropriate setting.



-----------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    BEACON EVERY/AFTER n
Mnemonic  :    B
Default   :    EVERY 0

Parameter :    EVERY     Send the beacon at regular
                         intervals.

               AFTER     Send the beacon once after the
                         specified time interval without
                         packet activity.

               n         0-250 specifies timing in 10 Sec.
                         intervals.

               0         Zero disables off the beacon
                         function.

Refer to  :    BTEXT, UNPROTO
------------------------------------------------------------
The  BEACON  command  sets  the  conditions under which your
packet beacon will be transmitted.

NOTE: A beacon frame contains the text you have  typed  into
the  BTEXT   message  in  a  packet  addressed 'CQ' or other
UNPROTO  address.

NOTE: A beacon frame may be sent directly, and also sent via
the digipeat addresses specified by the UNPROTO command.

When the keyword EVERY is specified, a beacon packet is sent
every n times 10 seconds.  This mode can be used to transmit
packets for testing purposes.

When  AFTER is specified,  a beacon is sent after n times 10
seconds have passed without packet activity.

NOTE: The beacon is sent only once until further activity is
detected.

This mode can be used to send announcements or test messages
only when packet stations are on the air.

NOTE: Proper choice of 'n' avoids cluttering a busy  channel
with lots of unnecessary transmissions.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    BBSMSGS ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    BBS
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Modify display message format to
                    terminal.

               OFF  Standard display message format.

Refer to  :    CONK, MONITOR, MBOD, NEWMODE, NOMODE, USERS
------------------------------------------------------------
When BBSMSGS is set to ON,  the TNC will output the terminal
with modified message format. The <LF> character is added to
in front of the display message.


<LF> *** CONNECTED
<LF> *** DISCONNECTED
<LF> *** retry limit exceeded
<LF> *** xxx Busy
<LF> *** FRAME sent
<LF> *** FRAME rcvd

In the above example,  the display message will include  the
<LF>.

When  this  command is active,  "*** Connect request: xxxx "
will not be displayed.

If BBSMSGS ON and CONOK OFF,  the TNC will  respond  to  all
connect request that you are busy, but the terminal will not
output  the  "***  Connect  request:  xxx  " message.   This
feature can be used while you  are  receiving  an  important
data from the other station,  and you do not want to disturb
by the connect request message.

CONOK OFF will reject all connection request.   Set CONOK ON
if you use BBS feature.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    BKONDEL ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    BK
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The sequence <BACKSPACE> <SPACE>
                    <BACKSPACE> is echoed when a character
                    is deleted from the input line.

               OFF  The <BACKSLASH> character <\> is echoed
                    when a character is deleted.

Refer to  :    REDISPLA
------------------------------------------------------------
BKONDEL  determines  how  character deletion is displayed in
Command or Converse mode.

The <BACKSPACE><SPACE><BACKSPACE> sequence updates the video
display screen.

NOTE: Set BKONDEL ON  if  you  are  using  a  video  display
terminal or computer.

On  a  printing terminal the <BACKSPACE> <SPACE> <BACKSPACE>
sequence will result in over-typed text.

NOTE: Set BKONDEL OFF if you have a paper output display, or
if  your  terminal  does  not  respond  to  the  <BACKSPACE>
character   <CNTRL-H>.

The  TNc  displays  a  <BACKSLASH>  for  each  character you
delete.  You can see a display of  the  corrected  input  by
typing  the  redisplay-line  character  set  by  the command
REDISPLA.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    BTEXT text
Mnemonic  :    BT
Default   :    Empty

Parameter :    Any combination of characters and spaces, up
               to a maximum length of 239 characters.

Refer to  :    BEACON, PASS
------------------------------------------------------------
BETEXT is the content  of  the  data  portion  of  a  beacon
packet. The default text is an empty string (no message).

NOTE:  BEACON packets are discussed in more detail under the
BEACON command.

You can  send  multiple-line  messages  in  your  beacon  by
including <CR>  characters in the text.  <CR> is inserted by
typing the PASS character(CTRL-V) before the <CR>.

NOTE: The pass character is set by the PASS command.

If you enter a text string longer than 239  characters,  the
command  line  is  ignored  and  the following error message
appears.

?too long

NOTE: Use a "%" or "&" as the first characters in the beacon
text to clear the  BTEXT  text  without  issuing  the  RESET
command.

Although  the  subject  of  beacon is conventional in packet
circles,  the following four suggestions will help  you  use
the feature intelligently and benefit the packet community:

1)  Do not type your call sign in BTEXT.   The normal packet
header shows it for you.

2) Do not fill your  BTEXT  with  screen  graphics  such  as
asterisk,  parentheses,  colons  and semicolons,  etc.   Use
BTEXT for some significant information.

3) Do not use BTEXT to tell the world that your  "DIGIPEATER
IS  ON"  and  "BUFFER  SAVE  TO  DISK IS ENABLE".   Put this
information in your CTEXT message so that it is seen by  any
station that connects you,  the only one who can make use of
the information.

4) After you have beaconed for a week or two and the  packet
community  has  learned  who  and where you are,  follow the
practice used by more experienced packeteers.    SET  BEACON
EVERY 0 !!!



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    BUDLIST ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    BU
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Ignore frames from station which are not
                    in the LCALLS list.

               OFF  Ignore frame from stations which are in
                    the LCALLS list.

Refer to  :    LCALLS, MONITOR
------------------------------------------------------------
BUDLIST works together with the LCALLS command, which allows
you  to  set  up a call sign list.  These commands determine
which packets are displayed when  you  set  MONITOR  to  ON.
BUDLIST  allows you to specify whether the call signs in the
list are those you wish to ignore,  or if they are the  ones
you want to displayed.

If you want your TNC to display packets only from a  limited
list,  use LCALLS to enter the list of call signs,  and then
set BUDLIST to ON.  This feature enables you to have the TNC
watch for a  particular  station  while  you  converse  with
another station.

If  you want your TNC to ignore packets from a limited list,
use  LCALLS to enter the list of call signs,  and  then  set
BUDLIST  to  OFF.    This is handy when you want to ignore a
bulletin board on the  frequency,  for  example,  while  you
monitor other conversations.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONNECT call1[VIA call2[,call3...,call9]]
Mnemonic  :    C
Default   :    Immediate command

Parameter :    call1     Call sign of the distant station to
                         which you wish to be connected.

               call2     Optional call sign(s) of up to
                         eight digipeaters via which you
                         want to be repeated to reach the
                         other station.

Refer to  :    DISCONNE
------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECT  sends a connect request to station 'call,' directly
or via one or more digipeaters.  Each call sign can  include
an optional SSID "n", immediately after the call sign.

The  part  of  the  command  line shown in brackets below is
optional.  The double-bracketed  text,  'call3...,call9'  is
also  optional  and  is  used only when 'VIA call2' is used,
that is,  when  you  are  connecting  through  one  or  more
digipeaters.  (The  brackets and quotation marks are used in
this text only for clarity. Do not  type them!)

VIA call2[,call3...,call9]

NOTE: Type the digipeater fields in the exact  sequence  you
wish to use to route your packets to the destination station
"call."

If you type CONNECT while your TNC is already connected,  or
trying to connect to or  disconnect  from  another  station,
your monitor will display.

Link state is:CONNECT in progress

If  the  other  station  does not "ack" your connect request
after the number of tries specified by  RETRY,  the  CONNECT
command is canceled and your monitor displays:

cmd: *** Retry count exceeded
*** DISCONNECTED: (call sign)
To connect directly to W6YEY, you would type:

CONNECT W6YEY (or C W6YEY)

To  connect  to  W6YEY using W6UOU (with whom you can easily
connect) and W6WNE (who is near W6YEY) as digipeaters, type:

CONNECT W6YEY VIA W6UOU, W6WNE

Type CONNECT or 'C' without arguments to see the link status
and the number of unacknowledged, outstanding packets.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CANLINE n
Mnemonic  :    CAN
Default   :    $18 <CTRL-X>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (o to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    CANPAC
------------------------------------------------------------
CANLINE   changes  the  CANCEL-LINE  input  editing  command
character.

The parameter "n" is the ASCII code for  the  character  you
want to use to cancel an input line.   The following example
show how to enter the code in hex and decimal.

CANLINE $15 (hex)
CANLINE 21  (decimal)

Either method sets the cancel-line character to <CTRL-U>.

When you use the CANLINE character to cancel an  input  line
in  the  Command  Mode,   the  line  is  terminated  with  a
<BACKSLASH> character and new prompt (cmd:) appears.

When you cancel a  line  in  the  Converse  Mode,  only  the
<BACKSLASH> and a new line appear.

NOTES:

1) You can cancel only the line you are currently typing.

2)  Once  you  type  a <CR>,  you cannot use the cancel-line
character to cancel an input line.

3) Use CANPAC character to cancel the entire packet.

4) If you send-packet character is not <CR>, the cancel-line
character cancels only the last line of a multiline packet.

Like all other input editing features,  line cancellation is
disable in the Transparent Mode.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CANPAC n
Mnemonic  :    CANP
Default   :    $19 <CTRL-Y>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    CANLINE
------------------------------------------------------------
CANPAC  changes  the  CANCEL-PACKET  input  editing  command
character.

The parameter "n" is the ASCII code for  the  character  you
want to type in order to cancel an input packet.

NOTE: You can enter the code in either hex or decimal.

When  you cancel a packet in the Converse Mode,  the line is
terminated with a <BACK SLASH> character and a new line.

NOTE: You can only cancel the packet that you care currently
entering.

Once you have typed the  send-packet  character,  or  waited
PACTIME  (if  PACTIME  is  enable),  the  packet  cannot  be
canceled even if it has not been transmitted.

Like other input editing features,  packet  cancellation  is
disabled in the Transparent Mode.

The  CANCEL-PACKET character also cancels the display output
in the Command Mode.   If the TNC is in the Command Mode and
you  type  the CANCEL-PACKET character,  any characters that
would be typed on  the  screen  (except  those  echoed)  are
"discarded" by the TNC.

NOTES:

1) Typing the cancel-output character a second time restores
normal output.

2) To see how this works, type DISPALY followed by a
<CTRL-Y>.

The  command list display will stop and you will not see any
response from the TNC.

To verify that the display is back to normal, type <CTRL-Y>,
and then type DISPLAY again.

Use the  CANCEL-DISPALY  feature  if  you  inadvertently  do
something  that  cause  the TNC to generate large amounts of
output to the terminal, such as entering the DISPLAY command
or setting TRACE ON.

NOTE: If the TNC is in the Converse or Transparent Mode  and
you  want  to  cancel  display output,  you must exit to the
Command Mode before you type the CANCEL-PACKET character.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CBELL ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CB
Default   :    OFF

Parameter:     ON   Three BELL characters <CTRL-G> ($07) are
                    sent to your terminal with the
                    '*** CONNECTED to (call sign)'message.

               OFF  BELLS are not sent with the CONNECTED
                    message.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

1) Set CBELL ON if you want to be notified whenever  someone
connects to your station.

2)  If CBELL is on and MFILTER contains the character ($07),
you can be sure that whenever your terminal beeps there is a
connection for you.  At no other time will you hear  a  beep
while the TNC is in the Packet Mode.

3)  This  feature  works  only the stream is set to "K" when
someone connected to MYMCALL.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CHECK n
Mnemonic  :    CH
Default   :    30

Parameter :    n    0 to 250 specifies the check time in 10
                    seconds intervals.

               0    Zero disables this feature.

Refer to  :    AX25L2V2, TOUT
------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK sets a time-out value for  a  packet  connection,  and
depends on the setting of AX25L2V2.

Without  the  CHECK  feature,  if  your  TNC  was  linked or
'connected' to another station and the other station  seemed
to 'disappear', your TNC would remain in the connected state
indefinitely, refusing connections from other stations.

This  might happen if propagation changes unexpectedly or an
intermediate digipeater station fails or is shut down  while
you   and   the  other  station  are  connected  'via'  that
digipeater.

Your TNC  tries  to  prevent  this  sort  of  'lockup'  from
occurring by
sending  a  new  connect  request packet when specified time
elapses without any packets being received  from  the  other
TNC.

If  Perversion  2  link  is  inactive  for  CHECK  times ten
seconds,   your TNC tries to save the  link  by  starting  a
reconnect sequence. The TNC enters the 'connect in progress'
state and sends SABM (connect request) frames.  In addition,
the TNC adds a random time of up to  30  seconds  each  time
CHECK is used.

NOTE:  If  AX25L2V2 is ON and packets have not been received
from the other station for 'n' times 10  seconds,  your  TNC
sends  a  'check packet' to test if the link still exists to
the other station.

The 'check' packet frame contains  no  information,  but  is
interpreted by the other station's TNC to see if it is still
connected. If the other station's TNC is still connected, it
sends an appropriate response packet.

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CMDTIME n
Mnemonic  :    CM
Default   :    1

Parameter :    n    0 to 250 specifies time-out value in 1
                    second intervals while in Transparent
                    Mode.

Refer to  :    COMMAND, TRANS
------------------------------------------------------------
If 'n' is 0 (zero) ,  you will have to send the BREAK signal
or interrupt power to the TNC to exit from Transparent Mode.

CMDTIME sets the time-out value in Transparent Mode. A guard
time of 'n' seconds allows escape to the Command  Mode  from
the  Transparent Mode,  while permitting any character to be
sent as data.

The same Command Mode  entry  character  (default  <CTRL-C>)
that  is used to exit from the Converse Mode is also used to
exit  the  Transparent  Mode,   although  the  procedure  is
different.

NOTES:

1) The Command Mode entry character is set by COMMAND.

2)  Three  Command Mode entry character must be entered less
than 'n' seconds  apart,  with  no  intervening  characters,
after  a  delay of 'n' seconds following the last characters
you typed.

3) After a final delay of 'n' seconds,  the  TNC  exits  the
Transparent Mode and enters the Command Mode.

4) You will then see the normal Command Mode prompt:

cmd:

The following diagram illustrates this timing:

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CMSG ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CMS
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The recorded CTEXT message is sent as
                    the first packet after a connection is
                    established by a connect request from
                    another station.

               OFF  The text message is not sent at all.

Refer to  :    CTEXT, DTEXT, CMSGDISC
------------------------------------------------------------
CMSG enables or disables automatic transmission of the CTEXT
or  DTEXT  message  when  your TNC accepts a connect request
from another station and disconnect it by another station.

If CMSGDISC is OFF, only CTEXT is sent.

If CMSGDISC is ON,  DTEXT is sent.  (If no message is in the
DTEXT  and  there  is  a message in CTEXT,  the CTXT is sent
instead of DTEXT and link is disconnected automatically.


NOTES:

1) Set CMSG ON to tell callers that you are not available to
answer calls manually when they connect to your TNC.

2) Set CMSG OFF when available to operate  or  answer  calls
manually.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CMSGDISC ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CMSGD
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Cause an automatic disconnect upon
                    completion of CTEXT or DTEXT message.

               OFF  The TNC will remain connected after it
                    sends the CTEXT except that if there is
                    a message in DTEXT.

Refer to  :    CTEXT, DTEXT, CMSG
------------------------------------------------------------
Normally,  you will want to set CMSGDISC to ON.  If CMSGDISC
is set to OFF and  another  station  connect  to  you,  your
station will remain in a connected state until either you or
the other station issue a DISCONNECT.

This  feature  helps prevent your station from being hang up
by a distant station that connects you,  but for some reason
cannot disconnect, such as fading band conditions.

If   both  CMSG  and  CMSGDISC  are  set  to  ON,   link  is
disconnected after sending out DTEXT message (if there is no
message in DTEXT, CTEXT will replace the DTEXT).

If no  messages  in  CTEXT  and  DTEXT,  the  link  is  also
disconnected as normal disconnect.

Normal   disconnect  process  is  performed  regardless  the
setting of CMSG.

NOTE: If CMSGDISC is set to ON,  make sure that the CMSG  is
also  ON.    If  the  CMSG  is set to OFF,  the link will be
disconnected after  you  sends  out  the  first  information
frame.

NOTE:  CMSGDISC  will  return to OFF state if you initiate a
connect request to the other station.  It also return to OFF
state, although you use the K stream switch,



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    COMMAND n
Mnemonic  :    COM
Default   :    $03 <CTRL-C>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    CMDTIME, CONVERSE, TRANS
------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND is used to change the Command Mode entry  character.
You can enter the code in either hex or decimal.

Type  the  COMMAND  character to enter the Command Mode from
Converse Mode.   You will not see a response if you type the
Command Mode entry character while the TNC is already in the
Command Mode.

To enter the Converse Mode type: CONVERSE

Now,  all  characters  typed  on the keyboard and characters
sent from a disk or tape files  are  transmitted  as  packet
data.

To return to the Command Mode,  type <CTRL-C>.   The Command
Mode prompt appears to indicate a  successful  exit  to  the
Command Mode. The display might look like this:

cmd: CONVERSE
Hello World! I'm on the air on packet radio! [type <CTRL-C>]
cmd:

Refer  to  the    CMDTIME    and  TRANS  to  escape from the
Transparent Mode.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONMODE CONVERSE/TRANS
Mnemonic  :    CONM
Default   :    CONVERSE

Parameter :    CONVERSE  Your TNC automatically enters the
                         Converse Mode when a connection is
                         established.

               TRANS     Your TNC automatically enters the
                         Transparent Mode when a connection
                         is established.

Refer to  :    CONVERSE, TRANS
------------------------------------------------------------
CONMODE selects the mode your TNC uses  after  entering  the
CONNECTED state.

The  connection  may  result  either  from a connect request
received from another station,  or a connection initiated by
a CONNECT command that you have typed.

NOTES:

1) Set CONMODE to CONVERSE for most packet operations.

2)  Set  CONMODE  to  TRANS if you are using the Transparent
Mode for a bulletin board program,  so that the correct mode
will  be      entered  when  your  bulletin board receives a
connect request.

3) If the TNC is already in  Converse  or  Transparent  Mode
when  the  connection  is  completed,  the  mode will not be
changed.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONOK ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CONO
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Connect requests from other stations are
                    accepted.

               OFF  Connect requests from other stations are
                    not accepted.

Refer to  :    BBSMSGS, USERS
------------------------------------------------------------
The CONOK command determines the action that  the  TNC  will
take  when  it  receives  a  connect  request  from  another
stations.     If  CONOK  is  set  to  ON,   the  request  is
acknowledged,  the normal connect message is displayed,  and
the TNC will enter either the Converse or  Transparent  Mode
(depending upon how you have CONMODE set.)

If CONOK is set to OFF and the TNC is not in the Transparent
Mode, it will display a connect request message:

Connect request : <call sign>

The TNC also issue a DM packet, like a "busy signal". to the
requesting  station.   If you wish,  you can then issue your
own connect command.   When your TNC receives a DM packet in
response to a connect request, it will display:

*** <call sign> station busy

If   you   are   connected  with  several  another  stations
(connected same number of stations set by USERS),  your  TNC
will respond to the same as above.

If,  for  example,  you  wish  to leave your station on as a
digipeater,  you could set CONOK to OFF until you are  ready
to communicate with another station.    When another station
attempts to connect to your TNC, it will be able to see that
your station is not available  for  a  connection,  but  can
still be used as a digipeater.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONPERM ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CONP
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The current connection on the current
                    channels is not allowed to enter the
                    disconnected state.

               OFF  The current channel can be connected to
                    and disconnected from other stations.

Refer to  :    RELINK, RETRY, TRIES
------------------------------------------------------------
When  it  is  ON,  CONPERM  forces  the  TNC to maintain the
current connection,  even when frames to the  other  station
exceed  RETRY  attempts for an acknowledgment.   RESTART and
power off/on cycling do not affect this connected state.

If disconnection is necessary,  set this command to OFF  and
proceed the normal disconnect sequence.

CONPERM  works  only  when  a connection is established.  It
functions  on  a  channel-by-channel  basis  when   multiple
connections are allowed.

CONPERM  allows  connections  on  other  channels to operate
normally. For example,  automatic disconnect based on RETRY,
when used under conditions such as:

* Certain networking applications.
* Meteor scatter.
* Other noisy, less reliable links.

CONPERM  ON  may  be  advantageous  when you use full-duplex
continuous mail forwarding or traffic links.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONSTAMP ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CONS
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Connect status messages are time stamped

               OFF  Connect status messages are not time
                    stamped.

Refer to  :    DAYTIME, DAYUSA
------------------------------------------------------------
CONSTAMP activates time stamping  of  ***  CONNECTED  status
messages.

If CONSTAMP is ON  and DAYTIME (the TNC's internal clock) is
set,  date  and  time  information  generated  in the TNC is
available for bulletin-board programs or other host computer
applications.

Date and time must be set initially by the  DAYTIME  command
before time stamping will occur. For example, if CONSTAMP is
ON and the date and time have been set in the TNC, a connect
and disconnect sequence appears as follows:

cmd: connect W6YEY
cmd: 10:55:23:26 *** CONNECTED to W6YEY
cmd: disconnect
cmd: 10:55:59:26 *** DISCONNECTED: W6YEY

The  CONNECT  and  DISCONNECT  command can be abbreviated as
shown below. The results are identical.

cmd: c W6YEY
10:56:22:18 *** CONNECTED to W6YEY
cmd: d
10:56:32:29 *** DISCONNECTED: W6YEY



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CONVERSE
Mnemonic  :    CONV or K
Default   :    Immediate Command
Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
CONVERSE is an immediate command  that  causes  the  TNC  to
change form the Command Mode to the Converse Mode.

When  the TNC is in the Converse Mode,  all characters typed
from the keyboard or sent from a disk file are processed and
transmitted by your radio.

NOTE: To return  the  TNC  to  the  Command  Mode  from  the
Converse     Mode,type  the  Command  Mode  entry  character
(default is <CTRL-C>).


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CPACTIME ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CP
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Packet transmit timer  is used in the
                    Converse Mode.

               OFF  Packet transmit timer is not used in the
                    Converse Mode.

Refer to  :    PACTIME
------------------------------------------------------------
CPACTIME  activates  automatic,   periodic  transmission  of
packets while the TNC is in the Converse Mode.

CPACTIME   may   be  used  for  several  types  of  computer
communications bulletin board  or  host  computer  operation
when you do not want the full Transparent Mode features.

NOTES:

1)  When  CPACTIME  is  ON,  characters  are  packetized and
transmitted periodically like they are  in  the  Transparent
Mode.  Local  keyboard  editing  and display features of the
Converse Mode are available;  software flow control  can  be
used.

2)  Refer  to the PACTIME command,  (which controls the rate
and mode  of  packet  assembly)  for  a  discussion  of  how
periodic packetizing works.

3)  Set  a CR OFF in this mode.  When a CR is ON,  the send-
packet character is inserted in the  data  being  packetized
even though it was not typed.

4)  To  include <CR> characters in transmitted packets,  set
SENDPAC to a character not normally used  (e.g.,  <CTRL-P>);
the TNC then treats a <CR> as an ordinary character.

Setting  CPACTIME ON transmits your text soon after you type
it,  in short bursts of a few characters.  The other station
may break in at will.  Some operators find it easier to chat
in this mode;  long delays are eliminated while long packets
are being typed.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CR ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    CR
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The send-packet character, normally
                    <CR>, is added to all packets sent in
                    the Converse Mode.

               OFF  The send-packet characters is not added
                    to packets.

Refer to  :    SENDPAC
------------------------------------------------------------
When CR is set to ON,  all packets  that  are  sent  in  the
Converse  Mode  will  include,  as the last character of the
packet,  the send-packet-character.   This character  causes
the packet to be sent.  If CR is set to OFF, the send-packet
character  is interpreted only as a command to the TNC,  and
is not included in the packet.  In addition,  it will not be
echoed to the terminal.

Set  CR  ON  and  SENDPAC  to $0D for a natural conversation
mode.   each line is sent whenever you  enter  a  <CR>,  and
arrives  at  the other station with a <CR> at the end of the
line.

NOTE: If the other station reports overprinting of the lines
on his display, you can set LFADD to ON or the other station
can set AUTOLF to ON.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CSTATUS
Mnemonic  :    CS
Default   :    Immediate command
Refer to  :    CONPERM
------------------------------------------------------------
CSTATUS is an immediate command that is used during multiple
connections. When you type CSTATUS, your monitor displays:

* The number of each logical channel.

* The link state of all ten logical channels.

* The current input/output channel - the one you are using.

* Whether each channel connection is 'permanent.'
(Refer to CONPERM)

Depending upon your use of multiple  connections  and  USERS
command, CSTATUS will display the following.

NOT CONNECTED TO ANY STATION
============================
cmd: CS
A stream - IO  Link state is: DISCONNECTED
B stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
C stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
D stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
E stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
F stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
G stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
H stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
I stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
J stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
K stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
cmd:

CONNECTED TO ONLY ONE STATION
=============================
cmd: CS
A stream - IO  Link state is: CONNECTED to W6YEY
B stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
C stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
D stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
E stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
F stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
G stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
H stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
I stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
J stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
K stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
cmd:

If  you  are  connected  to  several  stations,  the CSTATUS
command shows your connect status as follows:

CONNECTED TO SEVERAL STATIONS
============================
cmd: CS
A stream - I   Link state is: CONNECTED to W6YEY
B stream -     Link state is: CONNECTED to W6WNE
C stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
D stream -     Link state is: CONNECT in progress
E stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
F stream -     Link state is: CONNECTED to W6UOU via K7FT
G stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
H stream - O   Link state is: DISCONNECTED
I stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
J stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
K stream -     Link state is: DISCONNECTED
cmd:

This sample display shows that :

CHANNEL O has the input and output channels - you are  using
it.

CHANNEL I is the last channel stream you heard a packet.

All  other  channels'  states are shown as they might appear
with multiple connections.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    CTEXT text
Mnemonic  :    CT
Default   :    Empty

Parameter :    text Any combination of characters and spaces
                    up to a maximum of 239 characters.

Refer to  :    CMSG, CMSGDISC, DTEXT, PASS
------------------------------------------------------------
CTEXT is the 'automatic answer' text you type into a special
section of the TNC's memory.

If CMSG is set to ON,  the CTEXT message is sent  as  sooner
another station connects to your station.

To  type multiple-line CTEXT messages and include a carriage
return (<CR>) character in your text, use the PASS character
(<CTRL-V> is the default value)  immediately  preceding  the
carriage return (refer to the PASS command).

A typical CTEXT message might be:

I am not available right now <CTRL-V><CR>
Please leave your message, then disconnect <CR>

NOTE: If you enter a text string longer than 239 characters,
the  following  error  message  appears  and  the command is
ignored:

?too long
cmd:

Use a parent sign (%),  or an ampersand  (&)  as  the  first
character in the CTEXT message to clear the previous message
without having to type a RESET command.

The  CTEXT  message  will not be sent if the CMSG command is
set to OFF.

Since the CTEXT is affect by the  setting  of  CMSGDISC  and
DTEXT, refer to these command to set CTEXT properly.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DISCONNE
Mnemonic  :    D
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    CONNECT, CONPERM
------------------------------------------------------------
DISCONNE is an immediate command that initiates a disconnect
request to the other station to which you are connected.

If  you disconnect command is successful,  your monitor will
display:

*** DISCONNECTED^@

Other commands can be  entered  while  a  disconnect  is  in
progress.   New   connection   are  not  allowed  until  the
disconnect is completed.

NOTES:

1) If the retry count is exceeded while you are waiting  for
the  other  station  to acknowledge your disconnect command,
your TNC automatically switches to the disconnected state.

2) If another disconnect command is entered while  your  TNC
is trying to disconnect,  the retry count is immediately set
to the  maximum  number.    In  either  case,  your  monitor
displays:

*** Retry count exceeded
*** DISCONNECTED^@

Disconnect  message  are  not  displayed when your TNC is in
Transparent Mode.

NOTE: ^@ will not be displayed on the ordinary terminal.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DAYTIME date&time
Mnemonic  :    DA
Default   :    clock not set

Parameter :    date&time      Current DATE and TIME to set.

Refer to  :    CONSTAMP, DAYUSA, MSTAMP, MBOD
------------------------------------------------------------
DAYTIME sets the TNC's internal clock current date and time.
The date&time parameter is used in the Packet  Mode  by  the
commands  CONSTAMP  and  MSTAMP to 'time stamp' received and
monitored messages.

Entries in the "heard" (displayed ny MHEARD  are  also  time
stamped  if  data&time  has  been set.  The TNC time updates
continuously by back-up battery.

The clock is not set when the TNC is  first  turned  on,  or
when  the  TNC  is  rusted  by removing internal jumper plug
(JPC2),  the DAYTIME command will display:

cmd: DAYTIME
01/01/90 00:mm:ss

where "mm" and "ss" shows the time since first power  up  to
the internal clock.

If  you  type DAYTIME without a parameter,  the TNC displays
date and time information since 01/01/90 00:00:00.

The format for entering the date&time is:

YYMMDDhhmmss

where:

YY is the last two digit of the year. (00-99).
MM is the two digit month code (01-12).
DD is date (01-31).
hh is the hour (00-23).
mm is the minutes after the hour (00-59)
ss is the second after the minute (00-59)

Entering the number 0-9 with leading zeros;  all codes  must
be  exactly  two  digits.    The  TNC  will not echo the new
string,  thus you must issue DAYTIME command to  confirm  an
entry.

Example:

cmd: DAYTIME 9210030935
cmd: DAYTIME
92/10/03 09:35:10



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DAYSTAMP ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    DAYS
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The DATE is included in CONSTAMP and
                    MSTAMP.

               OFF  Only the TIME is included in CONSTAMP
                    and MSTAMP.

Refer to  :    TIME, DAYUSA, DAYTIME
------------------------------------------------------------
DAYSTAMP activates the date in CONSTAMP and MSTAMP.

Set  DAYTSAMP  to  ON when you want a dated record or packet
channel activity.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DAYUSA ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    DAYU
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Date is displayed in a mm/dd/yy format.

               OFF  Date is displayed in a dd-mm-yy format.

Refer to  :    CONSTAMP, DAYTIME, MSTAMP
------------------------------------------------------------
The DAYUSA command allows you to determines  the  format  of
the TNC's date display. If DAYUSA is set to ON, the standard
United Sates format is used.   If DAYUSA is set to OFF,  the
standard European format is used.   The command affects  the
format of the date display that is used in "time stamps.  It
also  affects  the  display when you enter a DAYTIME command
without parameters.

If DAYUSA is set to ON,  October 3,  1992  and  09:35:10  AM
would be displayed as:

cmd:DAYUSA ON
DAYUSA was ON
cmd:DAYTIME
10/03/92 09:35:10

If  DAYUSA  is  set to OFF,  the same date and time would be
displayed as:

cmd:DAYUSA OFF
DAYUSA was ON
cmd:DAYTIME
03-Oct-92 09:35:10



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DELETE ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    DEL
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The <DELETE> ($7F) key is used for
                    editing your typing.

               OFF  The <BACKSPACE> ($08) key is used for
                    editing your typing.

Refer to  :    BKONDEL, CANLINE
------------------------------------------------------------
Use the DELETE command to select the key to use for deleting
while editing.

Type the selected DEL key to delete the last character  from
the input line.

You  cannot  use  the  DEL  key  to  delete  text before the
beginning of a line.   Use the PASS character to delete <CR>
characters that have been typed into the text.

The BKONDEL command controls how the TNC indicates deletion.

To  see  a  corrected  display  of  the  current  line after
deleting  characters,  type  the  redisplay-line  character,
which is set by the REDISPLA command.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DIGIPEAT ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    DIG
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   The TNC will digipeat packets, if
                    another station requests it.

               OFF  The TNC will not digipeat packets.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
When  this  parameter  is  set  to  ON,  any  packet that is
received with your TNC's call sign (including SSID)  in  the
digipeater list of its address field will be re-transmitted.
Each  station that is included in the digipeater list relays
the packet,  in turn,  and will make the packet so  that  it
will not accidentally relay it twice (unless it is requested
to  do so.) In addition,  all stations will relay the packet
in the correct order.   Digipeating takes place concurrently
with other TNC operations and does not interfere with normal
operation of a packet station.

Many stations set DIGIPEAT to ON most of the time.   You may
wish to set it to OFF if you are not at  home,  or  if  your
transmitter/receiver relay makes enough noise to wake you up
at night.

The   HID   command  enables  automatic  re-transmission  of
identification  packets  when  your  station   acts   as   a
digipeater.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DISPLAY (class)
Mnemonic  :    DISP
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    class     Optional parameter identifier, one
                         of the following.

               (A)synchronous RS232C port parameters.
               (C)haracter display special characters.
               (H)ealth display health parameters.
               (I)d display ID parameters.
               (L)ink display Link parameters.
               (M)onitor display monitor parameters.
               (T)iming display timing parameters.
------------------------------------------------------------
If you type DISPLAY without a class parameter,  all  control
parameters and their current values are displayed.   You can
specify the optional parameter class to display subgroups of
related parameters.   To display  an  individual  parameter,
enter the parameter name without an option.

Example :

cmd: DISPLAY ASYNC  (or A)

All asynchronous port (RS-232C) parameters are displayed.

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    DWAIT n
Mnemonic  :    DW
Default   :    16

Parameter :    n    0 - 250 specifies default wait time in
                    10 mS intervals.

Refer to  :    TXDELAY, AXDELAY, AXHANG
------------------------------------------------------------
DWAIT helps to avoid collisions with digipeated packets.

Unless  the  TNC  is waiting to transmit digipeated packets,
DWAIT forces the TNC to pause after last hearing data on the
channel,  for the duration of the DWAIT (Default Wait) time,
before it begins its transmitter key-up sequence.

Wherever possible, the value of DWAIT should be agreed on by
all  stations  in  a local area when digipeaters are used in
the  area.   The  best   value   will   be   determined   by
experimenting.

DWAIT  is  a  function  of  the key-up time (TXDELAY) of the
digipeater  stations  and  helps   alleviate   the   drastic
reduction  of  throughput  that  occurs  on  a  channel when
digipeated packets suffer collisions.

DWAIT  is  necessary  because  digipeated  packets  are  not
retired  by the digipeater,  but are always restarted by the
originating station.   When all stations specify  a  default
wait time,  and right value of "n" is chosen, the digipeater
captures the frequency every time it has  data  to  send.  -
digipeated packets are sent without this delay.

NOTE:  The  TNC-210  set  DWAIT  value  to "0" automatically
regardless the value set by DWAIT.

TYPE OF OPERATION        TIME (mS)      DWAIT VALUE
=================        =========      ===========

     Digipeaters         00
     Local Keyboard      160            16 (default)
     PBBS                320            32
     File Transfer       480            48



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    ECHO ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    E
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Characters received from the computer or
                    terminal are echoed by the TNC.

               OFF  Characters are not echoed.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
The ECHO command controls local echoing by the TNC  when  it
is  in  the  Command  or  Converse  Mode.   Local echoing is
disable in the Transparent Mode.

Set ECHO ON if you do not see your  typing  appear  on  your
display.

SET ECHO OFF if you see each character you typed doubled.

ECHO  is  set correctly when you see the characters you type
display correctly.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    ESCAPE ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    ES
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The <ESCAPE> character ($1B) is output
                    as "$"($24).

               OFF  The <ESCAPE> character is output as
                    <ESCAPE> ($1B).

Refer to  :    AFILTER, MFILTER
------------------------------------------------------------
The ESCAPE command selects the character to be  output  when
an  <ESCAPE>  character  is to be sent to the terminal.  The
<ESCAPE> translation is disabled in Transparent Mode.

The ESCAPE character  selection  is  provided  because  some
computers  and  terminal  emulators  interpret  the <ESCAPE>
character as a special command prefix.   Such terminals  may
alter their displays depending upon the characters following
the <ESCAPE>.

Set  ESCAPE  ON  if  you  have  such  a  terminal  to  avoid
unexpected text strings from other packeteers.

Refer to the AFILTER and MFILTER  commands  for  information
about    character    stripping   (rather   than   character
translation) in monitored packets.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    FLOW ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    F
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Type-in flow control is active.

               OFF  Type-in flow control is not active.

Refer to  :    XFLOW, RSFLOW, FLOVER
------------------------------------------------------------
When FLOW is ON,  type-in  flow  control  is  active.    Any
character  typed on your keyboard causes output from the TNC
to  the  terminal  to  stop  until  any  of  the   following
conditions exist.

A packet is forced (in the Converse Mode).

A line is completed (in the Converse Mode).

The packet length (See PACLEN) is exceeded.

The terminal output buffer fills up.

Canceling  the  current  command  or  packet  or  typing the
redisplay-line  character  also  causes  output  to  resume.
Type-in flow control is not used in the Transparent Mode.

Setting  FLOW  ON  prevents  inbound  or  received data from
interfering with your keyboard data entry.   If you (and the
person  you  are talking to) normally wait for a packet from
the other end before starting to respond,  you can set  FLOW
OFF.

Some  packet  bulletin  board  programs (PBBS) may work best
with FLOW set to OFF.

Some computers with "software UARTs" may be unable  to  send
and  receive  data at the same time.   If you are using that
type of computer, set FLOW to ON.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    FRACK n
Mnemonic  :    FR
Default   :    3

Parameter :    n1 to 15, specifying frame acknowledgment
               time-out in one-second intervals.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
FRACK is the FRame ACKnowledgement time in seconds that your
TNC  will wait for acknowledgement of the last-sent protocol
frame before resending or "retiring" that frame.

After sending a packet requiring  acknowledgement,  the  TNC
waits  for  FRACK  seconds  time-out before incrementing the
retry counter and sending the frame again.   If  the  packet
address  includes digipeater instructions,  the time between
retries is adjusted to:

Retry interval = "n" x (2n x m +1)
where m is the number of intermediate relay stations.

When a packet is retries, a random wait time is added to any
other wait times in use.   This avoid lockups in  which  two
packet  stations  repeatedly send packets which collide with
each other.

Recommended value for the FRACK is as follows:

TYPE OF OPERATION        FRACK VALUE
=================        ===========

Local Keyboard           3 (default)
Local Keyboard           6 (when the channel is congested)
PBBS                     6
File Transfer            10



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    FULLDUP  ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    FU
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Full duplex mode is ENABLED.

               OFF  Full duplex mode is DISABLED.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
When full-duplex mode is disabled,  the TNC makes use of the
DCD  (Data  Carrier  Detect)  signal from its modem to avoid
collisions;  the TNC  acknowledges  multiple  packets  in  a
single transmission with a single acknowledgement.

When  full-duplex mode is enabled,  the TNC ignores  the DCD
signal and acknowledges packets individually.

Full-duplex  operation  is  useful  for  full-duplex   radio
operation, such as through AO-13 or JAS-1B. It should not be
used  unless  both  your  station  and the other station can
operate in full-duplex.

You may also find full-duplex mode useful for  some  testing
operations, such as analog or digital loopback tests.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    HBAUD n
Mnemonic  :    HB
Default   :    1200

Parameter :    n    Values specifying the rate or signaling
                    speed in bauds from the TNC to the
                    radio.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
HBAUD  sets  the radio (on-air) baud rate only in the packet
operating mode.   HBAUD has no relationship to your computer
terminal program,s baud rate.

You must use the same radio data rate as the other station.

NOTE:  Always set HBAUD to 1200.   The TNC will accept other
numbers, but the TNC's modem port is not acceptable of using
anything other than 1200 baud.

Example:HBAUD 1200

NOTE: Modern commercial and amateur  terminology  no  longer
always  refer to the speeds or data rate in "WPM".  The term
"bauds" is accepted for FSK and AFSK operations using  mono-
bit  data.   In these case,  the terms "bauds" and "bit-per-
second" mean the same thing.  Either term may be used.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    HEADERLN ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    HE
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The header for a monitored packet is
                    printed on a separate line from the
                    packet text.

               OFF  The header add the text of monitored
                    packets are printed on the same line.

Refer to  :    MRPT, MSTAMP
------------------------------------------------------------
HEADERLN affects the  display  of  monitored  packets.  When
HEADERLN  is  OFF,  the  address information is shown on the
same line as the packet text:

W6YEY>W6UOU: Go ahead and transfer the file.

When HEADERLN is ON,  the address is shown,  followed  by  a
<CR><LF>that puts the packet text on a separate line:

W6YEY>W6UOU:
Go ahead and transfer the file

If MRPT or MSTAMP are ON,  set HEADERLN ON; long headers may
extend across your screen or page when these  functions  are
active.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    HEALLED  ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    HEAL
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Automatically runs diagnostic tests on
                    the microprocessor when you turn the
                    unit on. If all checks are satisfactory,
                    it alternately lights the CON and STA
                    LEDs.

               OFF  Does not run diagnostic test and no LEDs
                    will light.

Refer to  :    MAIL, SOFTDCD
------------------------------------------------------------
Allows you to make a quick check of the TNC's operation.  If
you set HEALLED to ON and the LEDs do not alternately flash,
check  for  proper  power  supply  or  battery  voltage  and
connections.   If the LEDs do not flash,  the TNC's internal
software has failed.


NOTE:HEALLED  command  allows  the  user  to  redefine   the
functions of the two CPU controllable LEDs (i.e.  the STAtus
and CONnect LEDs).  When HEALLED is set to ON,  the two LEDs
flash in a seeming random fashion. At a glance, the user may
make  a judgment on whether the software has crashed,  since
the LEDs will probably  not  flash  if  the  software  falls
catastrophically.

With HEALLED set to OFF, the LEDs function as before.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    HID ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    HI
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Your TNC sends HDLC identification as
                    digipeater.

               OFF  Your TNC does not send HDLC
                    identification.

Refer to  :    UNPROTO, MYCALL, ID, MYALIAS
------------------------------------------------------------
The  HID  command activates or disables your TNC's automatic
periodic transmission of identification packets when  it  is
operating as digipeater.  This identification consists of an
un-sequenced  I-frame  with  your   station   identification
(MYCALL) and MYALIAS in the data field.

Set  HID ON to force your TNC to send an ID packet every 9.5
minutes when it is being used as digipeater.

The HID identification  packet  is  addressed  to  the  "CQ"
address set by the UNPROTO command.

Your  station  identification  is the call sign you have set
with the MYCALL command, with "digipeater" appended.

W6YEY >ID: W6WNE/R

NOTE: You cannot change the  9.5-minute  automatic  interval
timing.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    ID
Mnemonic  :    I
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    UNPROTO, MYCALL, HID
------------------------------------------------------------
ID   is   an   immediate   command   that  sends  a  special
identification packet.  The ID command allows you to send  a
final  identification  packet when you take your station off
the air.

Note that HID must set on.  ID forces a final identification
packet  to  be sent when a digipeater station is being taken
off the air.   The identification consists of an  unnumbered
I-Frame, with its data filed containing MYALIAS (if any) and
your MYCALL station identification and characters "/R".

The  ID identification packet is sent only if the digipeater
has transmitted since the last automatic identification.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    K
Mnemonic  :    K
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    Same as CONVERSE.  Refer to CONVERSE
------------------------------------------------------------




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    KILL
Mnemonic  :    KI
Default   :    Immediate Command

Refer to  :    "Using the Bulletin Board Feature" in the
               Operating Instruction Manual.
------------------------------------------------------------
KILL command erase the file or message in a BBS.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    LCOK ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    L
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Cause the TNC to send lower case
                    characters to the computer or terminal.

               OFF  Cause the TNC to translate lower case
                    characters to upper case.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
If  LCOK  is  OFF,  lower  case characters are translated to
upper case before they are sent  to  the  terminal.    Input
characters and echo are not translated.

NOTE: Case translation is disabled in Transparent Mode.

If  your  computer  or  terminal  does not accept lower case
characters,  it may react strangely when the TNC sends  them
to  it.   The LCOK command allows you to translate all lower
case characters that are received in  packets,  as  well  as
messages from the TNC, to upper case.

Since  echoes  of the characters you type are not translated
to uppercase,  you can use this command to make your display
easier  to  read when you converse in a connected mode.   If
you and the other station set LCOK to OFF, you can each type
your own message in  lower-case,  and  the  other  station's
incoming packets will be in upper case. This makes it easier
to distinguish between incoming and outgoing packets.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    LCALLS     call1,      call2     ..     call8
Mnemonic  :    LCA
Default   :    Empty

Parameter :    call Call sign list. Up to 8 calls, separated
                    by commas.

Refer to  :    BUDLIST
------------------------------------------------------------
LCALLS uses arguments to determine how your TNC monitors the
packet channels and displays information -  which  station's
packet will be displayed.

Each  call sign may include an optional SSID.   LCALLS works
with BUDLIST and it allows  selective  monitoring  of  other
packet stations.  LCALLS and BUDLIST determine which packets
will be displayed when you have set MONITOR ON.

BUDLIST specifies whether the call signs in the list are the
stations that you want to ignore or, alternatively, they are
the only stations that you want to monitor.

If you want to monitor only for packets from a limited list,
you may enter your selected stations in the LCALLS,  and set
BUDLIST to ON.

If you want to ignore packets from a limited list,  you  may
list  the call signs to ignore in the LCALLS and set BUDLIST
to OFF.



------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND   :    LCSTREAM ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    LCS
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Cause the character that immediately
                    follows the STREAMSWITCH character to be
                    changed uppercase, before it is acted
                    upon.

               OFF  Causes the character that immediately
                    follows the STREAMSWITCH character to be
                    acted upon normally.

Refer to  :    STREAMSW
------------------------------------------------------------
When LCSTREAM is set to ON the  character  that  immediately
follows  the STREAMSWITCH character is changed to upper case
before it is acted upon as  a  parameter  to  that  command.
Since  you  can specify the stream you desire with either an
uppercase or  a  lower-case  letter,  the  LCSTREAM  command
simplifies management of multiple connections.

When LCSTREAM is set to OFF,  the case of the character that
immediately follows the STREAMSWITCH character is important.
NOTE: A lower-case letter will result in an error message.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    LFADD ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    LF
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   A <LF> character is added to outgoing
                    packets following each <CR> transmitted
                    in the packet.

               OFF  No <LF> is added to outgoing packets.

Refer to  :    AUTOLF
------------------------------------------------------------
LFADD is similar to AUTOLF,  except the line feed characters
are added to outgoing packets instead of the displayed text.
This  feature  helps  make  your  TNC  compatible with other
packet radio TNCs.

Set LFADD to ON if the station you  are  communicating  with
reports that your packets are being overprinted.  NOTE: This
character is disabled in the Transparent Mode.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    LFIGNORE ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    LFI
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Causes the TNC to ignore <LF> characters
                    it receives from another station.

               OFF  Causes the TNC to print any <LF>
                    characters it receives.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
Set  LFIGNORE  to  ON if you feel you are receiving too many
line feeds from another station.   NOTE: This command has no
effect in the Transparent Mode.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    LIST
Mnemonic  :    L
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    None

Refer to  :    "Using the Bulletin Board Feature" in the
               Operating Instruction Manual.
------------------------------------------------------------
LIST command display the files or message in a BBS.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MONITOR ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    M
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Packet activity is monitored.

               OFF  Packet activity is not monitored.

Refer to  :    BUDLIST, LCALLS, MALL, MCON, MRPT, MSTAMP,
               MHEADERLN, MTR, RSFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
If MONITOR  is  set  to  ON  and  the  TNC  is  not  in  the
Transparent   Mode,   packets   not  addressed  to  you  are
displayed.   The addresses in the packet are displayed along
with the data portion of the packet. For example"

W6YEY > W6UOU-7: I am ready to transfer the file.

The  call  sign are separated by a ">" and the substation ID
field (SSID) is displayed if it is other than 0.   The MALL,
BUDLIST,  and LCALLS commands determine which packets are to
be monitored.   The MCON command controls the action of  the
monitor mode when the TNC is in a connected state.

All monitor functions are disabled in the Transparent Mode.

HEADERLEN  controls  the format of the monitor display.   If
you wish to see the station address on a separated line from
the text,  set HEADERLN ON.   MRPT enables monitoring of the
digipeater routing as well as source and destination address
for each packet.

MSTAMP  includes  a  time stamp with the address if you have
set DAYTIME.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MALL ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MA
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Both connected and non-connected packets
                    are monitored.

               OFF  Only non-connected packets are
                    monitored.

Refer to  :    MONITOR, BUDLIST, LCALLS, MTCALL, MRCALL, MTR
------------------------------------------------------------
The MALL command determines the class of monitored  packets.
When  MALL  is  set  to  OFF,  only packets from unconnected
stations determined by BUDLIST, LCALLS,  MTCALL,  MRCALL and
MTR are displayed.   This is the normal setting when you are
communicating to group of unconnected stations.

When MALL is set to ON,  all eligible frames are  displayed,
including  those  that  are sent between two other connected
stations.

The MALL command is handy  for  diagnostic  purpose  or  for
general monitoring.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MAXFRAME n
Mnemonic  :    MAX
Default   :    4

Parameter :    n    1 to 7 signifying a number of packet
                    frames.

Refer to  :    PACLEN, FULLDUP
------------------------------------------------------------
MAXFRAME sets an upper limit on unacknowledged packets  your
TNC  permits  on  the radio link at any one time.   MAXFRAME
also sets the maximum number of contiguous packets your  TNC
will send during any given transmission.

If   some  but  not  all  of  the  outstanding  packets  are
acknowledged,  a smaller number may be transmitted the  next
time, or new frames
may  be  included  in  the re-transmission so that the total
number of unacknowledged packet frame does not exceed "n".

The best value of MAXFRAME depends upon your  local  channel
conditions.  In  most case of keyboard-to-keyboard direct or
local operation (link that  do  not  require  going  through
digipeaters), you can use the default value MAXFRAME 4.

When  the  amount  of packet traffic,  the path in use,  the
digipeaters involved,  or other  variables  not  under  your
control make packet operation difficult (as shown by lots of
retries!),  you  can  actually  improve  your  throughput by
reducing MAXFRAME.

If packet traffic is heavy  or  the  path  is  poor,  reduce
MAXFRAME to 3 or 2.

If  you  are  sharing  the  channel  with  several PBBSs and
digipeaters,  or when you are working a PBBSs or other  type
of host communications, reduce MAXFRAME to 1.

If  the  radio link is good,  an optimal relationship exists
between the parameters set by these commands,  so  that  the
maximum number of characters outstanding does not exceed the
receive buffer space of the TNC receiving data.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MBOD ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MB
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Turn the message (bulletin) board on.

               OFF  Turn the message (bulletin) board off.

Refer to  :    MYMCALL, DAYTIME
------------------------------------------------------------
This  TNC  has  built-in bulletin board capability.   To use
this feature, you must set MBOD to ON.   Before you do this,
however,  make  sure that you have entered an exclusive call
sign in MYMCALL.

NOTE: To use the bulletin board feature,  you must  enter  a
call sign into MYMCALL.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MCON ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MC
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Monitors packets from all other stations
                    while your TNC is connected to another
                    station.

               OFF  Only monitors packets from the station
                    you are connected to.

Refer to  :    MALL, MONITOR
------------------------------------------------------------
Turn  MCON  ON  to  monitor  other stations on the frequency
while your TNC is connected to another station.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MCOM  ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MCOM
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Connected, disconnected, information, UA
                    (Unnumbered Acknowledgement), and DM
                    (busy signal) frames are monitored.

               OFF  Only information frames are monitored.

Refer to  :    MALL, MONITOR
------------------------------------------------------------
When MCON is set to  ON,  both  connected  and  disconnected
frames  are  displayed,  if  MONITOR  is  also  set  to  ON.
Connected, disconnected,  information,  UA and DM frames are
indicated by <C>,  <D>,  <I>,  <UA>, and <DM>, respectively.
Like other monitor commands, stations that are monitored are
determined by BUDLIST and LCALLS.

Set MCOM to OFF to  display  only  I  frames  (packets  that
contain user information).



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MFILETER n1[, n2[,n3[,n4]]]
Mnemonic  :    MFI
Default   :    $00

Parameter :    0 to $7F0 (0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
               ASCII code. Up to four characters may be
               specified.

Refer to  :    AFILTER
------------------------------------------------------------
Use  MFILTER  to  select  characters  to  be "filtered",  or
excluded from  monitored  packets.  Parameters  "n1,"  "n2",
etc.,  are  the  ASCII  codes for the characters you want to
filter.   You can enter up to four characters in either  hex
or decimal.

1)  To  prevent  a  <CTRL-L>  character  from  clearing your
screen, set MFILTER 12.

2) To eliminate  <CTRL-Z>  character,  which  some  computer
interpret as end-of-file markers, set MFILTER 26.

3)  To  eliminate  <CTRL-G>  characters,   which  beep  your
computer or terminal, set MFILTER 7.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MHEARD
Mnemonic  :    MH
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    MSTAMP, MHCLEAR
------------------------------------------------------------
MHEARD is an immediate  command  that  displays  a  list  of
stations  heard  since  the  last time the MHEARD buffer was
cleared.

Use the MHC command to clear the MHEARD buffer.

The maximum number of heard stations that can be  logged  is
18.    If  more  stations  are  heard,  earlier  entries are
discarded.

NOTES:

1) Stations that are heard directly are not marked with a  *
in the heard log.

2)  Stations  that  have  been  repeated by a digipeater are
marked.

3) If you clear the list of stations heard at the  beginning
of a session,  you can use this command to keep track of the
stations that are active during that period.

4) Logging of stations heard is disabled when PASSALL is ON.

When DAYTIME has been used to set the date and time, entries
in the heard log are time stamped.  When DAYSTAMP is ON, the
date is shown before the time.  An actual sample  of  MHEARD
functions with clock set is shown below:


DAYSTAMP ON                        DAYSTAMP OFF

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MHCLEAR
Mnemonic  :    MHC
Default   :    Immediate Command

parameter :    none

Refer to  :    MHEARD
------------------------------------------------------------
The MHCLEAR command clears the list of stations heard.   You
can use this command together with the MHEARD to keep  track
of any stations heard over a particular period of time, such
as evening or a week.  Be sure to clear the list of stations
heard when you first begin to monitor packet activity.

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MRPT ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MR
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Show digipeaters in the header; stations
                    heard directly are marked with asterisk.

               OFF  Show packets only from originating and
                    destination stations.

Refer to  :    HEADERLN
------------------------------------------------------------
MRPT affects the way monitored packets are displayed. When
MRPT is OFF, only packets from the originating station and
the destination station are displayed:

W6YEY*> W6UOU-7<I;0,3>:

In  addition,  while  MRPT  is OFF,  the TNC will remove all
indications of digipeater paths in connect requests, and all
connect and disconnect stamps.

When MRPT is ON,  the call signs  of  all  stations  in  the
entire  digipeat  path  are displayed.  The call sign of the
stations received directly are flagged with an asterisk (*):

W6YEY*>W6UOU-7>W6WNE>K7FT <I;0,3>:


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MSTAMP ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    MS
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Monitored frames ARE time stamped

               OFF  Monitored frames ARE NOT time stamped.

Refer to  :    HEADERLN, DAYTIME, DAYUSA, CONSTAMP
------------------------------------------------------------
The  MSATMP  command  activate  or disables time stamping of
monitored packets.   When your TNC's internal clock is  set,
date and time information is available for automatic logging
of packet activity or other applications.

When  MSTAMP  is  OFF,  the packet header display looks like
this:

W6YEY-7>W6UOU-7>W6WNE <I,2,2>

When MSATMP is ON and DAYSTAMP is  OFF,  the  display  looks
like this:

18:50:13 W6YEY-7>W6UOU-7>W6WNE <I,7,1>

When both MSATMP and DAYSTAMP are set ON,  the display looks
like this:

10-Oct-92 22:10:45 W6YEY-7>W6UOY-7>W6WNE <I,2,2>

Set the date and time with the DAYTIME command.

Setting  MSTAMP  ON  increase  the  length  of  the  address
display.

Set  HEADERLN  ON  to display this information on a separate
line.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MYCALL call (-n)
Mnemonic  :    MY
Default   :    NOCALL

Parameters:    call your call sign

               n    0 to 15, indicating an optional
                    substation ID (SSID)

Refer to  :    MYALIAS, ID, HID, MYMCALL, CONNECT, XMITOK
------------------------------------------------------------
Use  the  MYCALL  command  to  load your call sing into your
TNC's RAM.   Your call sign is inserted automatically in the
FROM  address  field for all packets originated by your TNC.
MYCALL is also used for identification packets (see HID  and
ID).

Your  TNC accepts connect request frames with your MYCALL in
the TO field and repeats frames with this call sign  in  the
digipeated field.

NOTE:  The factory default is set to "NOCALL" and you cannot
send any data until you set to your own unique ID.

Two  or  more  stations  cannot  use  the  same  call   sign
(including SSID) on the air at the same time.

Use  SSID  to distinguish between two stations with the same
call sign.

The SSID will be zero(0) unless explicitly  set  to  another
value.

Although  there  is  no standardization of SSIDs at present,
most packet operators use SSID 0 (zero) for manual or  local
keyboard operation of their main station,  and an SSID of (-
1) or (-2) for a secondary station or  dedicated  digipeater
under their responsibility.

Local area networks operated or maintained by a packet group
or  club  may use the same call sign for several stations in
their network,  each node or unit being  identified  with  a
deferent SSID.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    MYALIAS call (-n)
Mnemonic  :    MYA
Default   :    Empty

Parameter :    call Alternate identity of your TNC.

               n    0 to 15, an optional substation ID
                    (SSID).

Refer to  :    MYCALL, ID, HID, DIGIPEAT, MYMCALL
------------------------------------------------------------
MYALIAS specifies an alternate call sign (in addition to the
call sign specified in MYCALL) for use as a digipeater only.

NOTE:  The  TNC  will not allow other stations to connect to
your MYALIAS call sign.

MYALIAS permits both normal HID identification and an  alias
alternate, repeater-only "call sign."

Wide-coverage  digipeater  operators  in  some  areas change
their call  sign  to  a  shorter  and  (usually)  easier  to
remember identifier.

Identifiers   used   include  International  Civil  Aviation
Organization (ICAO) airport  IDs,  sometimes  combined  with
telephone area codes.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    NEWMODE ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    NE
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   At connect time, the TNC automatically
                    goes to the mode specified by CONMODE
                    and return to the Command Mode at
                    disconnect.

               OFF  At connect time, the TNC automatically
                    goes to the mode specified by CONMODE as
                    soon as the link is established. The TNC
                    does not return to the Command Mode at
                    disconnect.

Refer to  :    CONMODE, NOMODE, CONNECT
------------------------------------------------------------
NEWMODE  determines  how  the  TNc behaves when the link  is
broken.   The TNC always switches to a mode specified by the
CONMODE at the time of connection, unless NOMODE is ON.

Set NEWMODE for the type of operation most suitable to your
needs.

If NEWMODE is OFF and the link is disconnected, the TNc
remains in converse or transparent mode unless you have
forced it to return.

When NEWMODE is ON and the link is disconnected, or if the
connect attempt fails, the TNC returns to the Command Mode.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    NOMODE   ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    NO
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The TNC does not switch the mode
                    specified by CONMODE and NEWMODE
                    automatically.



               OFF  The TNC switch the mode specified by
                    CONMODE and NEWMODE automatically.


Refer to  :    CONMODE, NEWMODE
------------------------------------------------------------
When  NOMODE is ON,  the TNC never switches from Converse or
Transparent mode to command mode (or vice verse) by  itself.
Only  specific commands (CONVERSE,  K,  TRANS,  or <CTRL-C>)
typed by you can change the operating mode.

When NOMODE is OFF,  the TNC  switches  modes  automatically
according to the way NEWMODE and CONMODE is set.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    NUCR ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    NU
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   <NULL> characters ARE sent to the
                    terminal following <CR> characters.

               OFF  <NULL> characters are not sent to the
                    terminal <CR> characters.

Refer to  :    NULF, NULLS
------------------------------------------------------------
Some  of  the  older  electromechanical  terminal  (Teletype
machines) and printer terminals require some extra time  for
the  printing  head to do a line feed and return to the left
margin.  NUCR ON solves this problem by making the TNC  send
<NULL>  characters  (ASCII  code  $00)  to  your computer or
terminal. This introduces any necessary delay after any <CR>
sent to the terminal.

The NULLS command  sets  the  number  of  individual  <NULL>
characters that are to be sent when NUCR is ON.

NOTE:  Set NUCR ON if your terminal or printer misses one or
more characters after responding to a <CR>.  If this is  the
case, you will sometimes see overtyped lines.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    NULF ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    NUL
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   <NULL> characters are sent to the
                    terminal following <LF> characters.

               OFF  <NULL> characters are not sent to the
                    terminal following <LF> characters.

Refer to  :    NUCR, NULLS



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    NULLS n
Mnemonic  :    NULL
Default   :    0

Parameter :    n    0 to 30 specifies the number of <NULL>
                    characters to be sent to your computer
                    or terminal after <CR> or <LF> when NUCR
                    or NULF are set ON

Refer to  :    NUCR, NULF
------------------------------------------------------------
NULLS specifies the number of <NULL> characters  (ASCII code
$00) to be sent to the terminal after <CR> or <LF> is sent.

NUCR  and/or  NULF must be set to indicate whether nulls are
to be sent after <CR>, <LF>, or both.

Devices requiring null after <CR>  are  typically  hard-copy
devices requiring time for carriage movement.   Devices that
require null after  <LF>  are  typically  CRTs  that  scroll
slowly.

The  null characters are sent from your TNC to your computer
only in the Converse and Command Modes.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    PACLEN n
Mnemonic  :    PACL
Default   :    128

Parameter :    n    0 to 255 specifies the maximum length of
                    the data portion of a packet.

               0    Zero is equivalent to 256

Refer to  :    MAXFRAME
------------------------------------------------------------
PACLEN sets the maximum number of  user  data  bytes  to  be
carried  in  each  packet's information field.   "User data"
means the characters you actually type at your keyboard  (or
send form a stored file).

Your TNC automatically transmits a packet when the number of
characters  you type (or send from disk) for a packet equals
"n".     This  value  is  used  in  both  the  Converse  and
Transparent Modes.

Most keyboard-to-keyboard operators use the default value of
128 bytes for routine VHF/UHF packet service.

Experiment  with  deferent values for MAXFRAME and PACLEN to
find  the  combination  best  suited   to   your   operating
conditions, especially if you are transferring files.

The  lower the value of PACLEN,  the greater the possibility
of  getting  packets  though  the  link  without  "hits"  or
retries.

Increase  PACLEN  to  256  bytes  if transferring files to a
nearby station over a high quality path.

Reduce PACLEN to 64,  or even 32 when working "difficult" or
marginal radio path.

If  the  radio  link  is good,  an optimal relationship will
exist between the parameters  set  by  these  commands.  Set
PACLEN  so that the maximum number of characters outstanding
does  not  exceed  the  receive  buffer  space  of  the  TNC
receiving data.

NOTE:  It  is not necessary that two TNCs be set to the same
PACLEN value to exchange data; some TNCs,  however,  may not
be  compatible  when  frames  contain  more  than  128  data
characters.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    PACTIME EVERY/AFTER n
Mnemonic  :    PACT
Default   :    AFTER 10

Parameter :    n         0 to 250 specifies 100 millisecond
                         intervals.

               EVERY     Packet time-out occurs every "n"
                         times 100 mS.

               AFTER     Packet time-out occurs when "n"
                         times 100 mS. elapse without
                         input from the computer or
                         terminal.

Refer to  :    CPACTIME, TRANS
------------------------------------------------------------
A PACTIME parameter is always used in the Transparent  Mode.
PACTIME is also set in the Converse Mode if CPACTIME is on.

When  EVERY  is  specified,  the characters you type or send
from disk are packetized and queued for  transmission  every
"n" times 100 mS.

When  AFTER  is  specified,  the characters you type or send
from disk are packetized when input from the terminal  stops
for "n" times 100 mS.

A  zero-length  packet will never be produced.  The timer is
not started until the first character or byte is entered.

A value of 0(zero) for "n" is allowed;  zero  means  packets
are sent with no wait time.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    PARITY n
Mnemonic  :    PAR
Default   :    3

Parameter :    n    0 to 3 selects a parity option from the
                    table below.

Refer to  :    AWLEN, 8BITCONV, RESTART
------------------------------------------------------------
PARITY  sets  the TNC's data parity for terminal or computer
data transfer according to the following table:

0 = no parity
1 = odd parity
2 = no parity
3 = even parity

The parity bit,  if present,  is stripped  automatically  on
input, and is not checked in the Command and Converse Modes.

In  the  Transparent  Mode all eight bits (including parity)
are transmitted in packets.  When "no  parity"  is  set  and
AWLEN is 7, the eighth bit is set to 0 (zero).



____________________________________________________________
Command   :    PASS n
Mnemonic  :    PAS
Default   :    $16 <CTRL-V>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F(0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    BTEXT, CTEXT, DTEXT, MTEXT
------------------------------------------------------------
PASS  selects  the ASCII character used for the "pass" input
editing command.

The  Parameter  "n"  is  the  numeric  ASCII  code  for  the
character   you  will  use  to  signal  that  the  character
immediately following it is to be included in  a  packet  or
text string.

NOTE: You can enter the code in either hex or decimal.

Use  the  PASS  character  (default  is  <CTRL-V>)  to  send
characters that usually have special functions.

A common use for the pass character is to allow <CR>  to  be
included  in the BTEXT,  CTEXT,  DTEXT and MTEXT messages so
that the transmitted information appears  on  several  short
lines rather than a single longer line.

Use  the PASS character to insert <CR> at the end of a short
line:

Example:

BT Notice: <CTRL-V><CTRL-M>
Meeting at the Firehouse tonight <CTRL-V><CTRL-M>
at 8:00 PM. All welcome ! <CR>

The other station's monitor shows:

Notice:
Meeting at the Firehouse tonight
at 8:00 PM. All welcome !

Without the PASS character, the ,message would probably look
this:

Notice: Meeting at the Firehouse tonight  at  8:00  PM.  All
welcome !

In like manner, you can include <CR> in text when you are in
the  Converse  Mode to send multiline packets.  (The default
send-packet character is <CR>.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    PASSALL  ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    PASSA
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Your TNC will accept packets with
               invalid CRCs (Cyclic Redundancy Check).

               OFF  Your TNC will only accept packets with
                    valid CRCs.

Refer to  :    MHEARD, RETRY
------------------------------------------------------------
PASSALL permits the TNC to  display  packets  received  with
invalid CRC fields;  the error-detecting mechanism is turned
off.

Packets are accepted for display despite CRC errors if  they
consists of an even multiple of eight bits and are up to 330
bytes.  The  TNC  attempts  to  decode the address field and
displays the call sign(s) in the  standard  monitor  format,
followed by the text of the packet.

PASSALL  is  normally  turned off,  therefore,  the protocol
ensures that received packet data is error-free by rejecting
packets with invalid CRC fields.

PASS (sometimes called "Garbage Mode")  may  be  useful  for
testing  a  marginal RF link or during operation under other
unusual conditions or circumstances.

When you set PASSALL ON, while monitoring a moderately noisy
channel "packets" are displayed periodically  because  there
is  no  basis  for distinguishing between actual packets and
random noise.

NOTE: When PASALL is  ON,  logging  of  station  heard  (for
display  by MHEARD) is disabled;  the call sign detected may
be incorrect.



------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND   :    PERSIST n
Mnemonic  :    PE
Default   :    127


Parameter :    n    0 to 255 specifies the threshold value
                    for random number attempt to transmit.

               0    Signifies a 1/256th chance of
                    transmitting every SLOTTIME.

               255  Causes the TNC to transmit right away
                    without delay.

Refer to  :    PPERSIST, SLOTTIME
------------------------------------------------------------
The PERSIST command  works  with  the  SLOTTIME  command  to
achieve   true  p-persistent  CSMA  (Carrier-Sense  Multiple
Access)in the KISS TNC mode and in AX.25 operation.

However,  no  real  advantage  will  be  obtained  in  AX.25
operation  unless the order stations on the channel are also
using PERSIST and SLOTTIME.

When  the  host  (your  computer)  has   queued   data   for
transmission,  the  TNC  monitors  DCD (Data Carrier Detect)
signal from its internal modem.  The TNC waits  indefinitely
for DCD to go inactive.

When the Channel is clear, the TNC generates a random number
between  0 and 255.  If this number is less than or equal to
"P" the TNC keys the radio's PTT line,  wait 0.01 x  TXDELAY
seconds, and then transmits all frames in the queue. The TNC
then unkeys the PTT line ad returns to the idle state.

If the random number is greater than "P",  the TNC wait 0.01
x SLOTTIME seconds and repeats the procedure.   If  the  DCD
signal has gone active during this wait time,  the TNC waits
for DCD to clear before it continues.

The TNC waits an exponentially-distributed  random  interval
after it senses that the channel is clear before it tries to
transmit.  When  PERSIST  and  SLOTTIME  are  carefully set,
several stations sending traffic are  much  less  likely  to
collide with each other when they simultaneously detect that
the channel is clear.

NOTE: P=255 directs the TNC to transmit as soon as possible,
regardless of the random number.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    PPERSIST ON/ OFF
Mnemonic  :    PP
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   The TNC uses PERSIST and SLOTTIME
                    parameters when it executes p-persistent
                    CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access).

               OFF  The TNC uses DWAIT for TAPR-type 1
                    persistent CSMA.

Refer to  :    PERSIST, SLOTTIME
-----------------------------------------------------------
When  PPERSIST  is  set to ON,  the TNC uses the PERSIST and
SLOTTIME parameters for p-persistent CSMA instead of  normal
TAPR-type   DWAIT   procedure  to  achieve  CSMA  operation.
PPERSIST may be used in  both  KISS  TNC  and  normal  AX.25
operation.

Set  PPERSIST  to  ON  if you operate the frequency has many
PBBSs activity.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    READ
Mnemonic  :    R
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    "Using the Bulletin Board Feature" in the
Operating Instruction Manual.
------------------------------------------------------------
READ command reads BBS files.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RETRY n
Mnemonic  :    RE
Default   :    10

Parameter :    n    0 to 15 specifies the maximum number of
                    packet retries.

Refer to  :    FRACK, CONPERM, TRIES
------------------------------------------------------------
The AX.25 protocol uses retries -  re-transmission of frames
that have not been acknowledged.   Frames are re-transmitted
"n" times before the link is disconnected.

The  time between retries specified by the command FRACK.  A
value of 0 for "n" specifies an infinite number of retries.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RECONNECT  call1[VIA call2[,call3...call9]]
Mnemonic  :    REC
Default   :    Immediate command

Parameter :    call1     This is the call sign of the
                         station you are trying to reconnect
                         to.

               call2     Optional call sign(s) or station(s)
                         you are attempting to digipeat
                         through.  You can use up to eight
                         digipeat stations.

Refer to  :    CONNECT, DISCONNE
------------------------------------------------------------
The RECONNECT command allows you to change the path you  are
using  to  communicate  with  another  station.  NOTE:  This
command works only when you are  already  connected  to  the
station you are attempting to reconnect to.

When you use this command, any frames that may be in process
between your station and the station you are reconnecting to
may be lost.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    REDISPLA   n
Mnemonic  :    RED
Default   :    $12 <CTRL-R>

Parameter :    n    0  to $7F (0 to 127 decimal)
                    specifies an ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    FLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
REDISPLA  changes the redisplay-line input editing character
code.

Parameter "n" is the numeric ASCII code  for  the  character
you  will  use when you want to re-display the current input
line.

NOTE: You can enter the code in either hex or decimal.

Type the REDISPLA character to re-display a  line  you  have
just typed.  The following things will happen:

1) Type-in flow control is temporarily turned off (if it had
been  active).  Any  incoming  packets  that are pending are
displayed.

2) A <BACKSLASH> is appended to the line you just typed  and
the line is shown below it.  Only the final form of the line
is shown if you have deleted or changed any characters.

3) You can now continue typing where you left off.

Use the redisplay-line character to see a  "clean"  copy  of
your input if you are using a printing terminal and you have
deleted characters.

If  BKONDEL  is  set  OFF,  deletions  are  designated  with
<BACKSLASH> characters, rather than by trying to correct the
input line display.   The re-display line is  the  corrected
text.

Use the REDISPLA character if a packet is received while you
are typing a message in the Converse Mode.   You can see the
incoming  message  before  you  send  your  packet   without
canceling your input.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RESPTIME  n
Mnemonic  :    RES
Default   :    5

Parameter :    n    0 to 250 specifies 100 millisecond
                    intervals.

Refer to  :    DWAIT
------------------------------------------------------------
RESPTIME  adds  a  minimum  delay  before  the   TNC   sends
acknowledgment packets. This delay may run concurrently with
the  default  wait  time set by DWAIT and any random wait in
effect.

Use RESPTIME delay to increase throughput during  operations
such as file transfer when the sending TNC usually sends the
maximum number of full-length packets.

Occasionally,  the  sending TNC many not have a packet ready
in  time  to  prevent  transmission   from   being   stopped
temporarily,  with  the  result  that the acknowledgement of
earlier packets  collides  with  the  final  packet  of  the
series.

These  collisions  can  be avoided if the receiving TNC sets
RESPTIME to 10.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RESET
Mnemonic  :    RESET
Default   :    Immediate command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    RESTART, RAMTEST
------------------------------------------------------------
RESET is an immediate command that resets all parameters  to
the TNC's PROM default settings and reinitializes the TNC.

WARNING:   All personalized parameters are monitor lists are
lost.

To reinitialize the TNC using the parameter values in bbRAM,
turn the TNC off then on, or use the RESTART command.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RESTART
Mnemonic  :    RESTART
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    RESET, RAMTEST
------------------------------------------------------------
RESTART is an immediate command that reinitializes  the  TNC
using   the   defaults   stored  in  the  TNC  bbRAM.   Your
personalized  parameter  settings  are  retained  unchanged,
except data stored in MHARD and LOG.

The effect of the RESTART command is the same as turning the
TNC OFF, then ON again.

RESTART  does  not reset the parameter values in bbRAM.  See
the RESET command.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RSFLOW ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    RS
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   Enables hardware flow control.

               OFF  Disable the hardware flow control when
                    the XFLOW is set to ON.

Refer to  :    XFLOW, FLOVER
------------------------------------------------------------
RSFLOW is select the method of flow control between your TNC
and terminal.

When RSFLOW is set to ON, the flow control is performed same
as the TAPR TNC-2. (If XFLOW is set to ON, both software and
hardware flow control is performed.)

When  RSFLOW  is  set  to  OFF,  software  flow  control  is
performed only when the XFLOW is set to ON.  If XFLOW is set
to  OFF,   only  hardware  flow  control  (DTR  or  RTS)  is
performed.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    RXBLOCK ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    RX
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Direct the TNC to pace a $FF mark in
                    front of received packets before they
                    are printed on your terminal.

               OFF  Does not place a $FF mark in front of
                    received packets.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
The $FF mark makes easier to identify incoming packets.

When RXBLOCK is ON, your TNC automatically places a $FF mark
in front of all incoming packets.  The order of identity is:

 -----------------------------------------------------
|  $FF   |   LH    |   LL   |   PID   |  DATA UNIT    |
 -----------------------------------------------------
(PREFIX )  (LENGTH)        (PID)           (DATA)

where :

$FF is the header identify block (1 byte).

LH is the block length high byte (1 byte,  high 4  bit,  111
fixed).

LL is the block length low byte (1 byte).

PID  is  the  protocol  indent  of  the control field of the
received packet.

DATA UNIT is the contents of the received packet.

NOTE: When  use  this  command,  check  AUTOLF  and  MFILTER
settings.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    SCREENLN n
Mnemonic  :    S
Default   :    0

Parameter :    n    0 to 255 specifies the screen or platen
                    width,in characters, of the terminal.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
The  SCREENLN  command  allows  you  to properly format your
terminal's output.   A <CR>,  <LF> sequence is sent  to  the
terminal  at  the  end of a line in the Command and Converse
modes after "n" characters have been printed.  An "n"  value
of zero inhibits this function.

NOTE:  If  your computer automatically formats output lines,
set SCREENLN 0 to avoid a  conflict  between  the  two  line
formats.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    SENDPAC n
Mnemonic  :    SE
Default   :    $0D<CTRL-M>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F ( 0 to 127 decimal) specifies
                    an ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    PACLEN, CR, CPACTIME
------------------------------------------------------------
Use  the  SENDPAC  command  to  select the character used to
force a  packet  to  be  sent  in  the  Converse  Mode.  The
parameter  "n"  is  the numeric ASCII code for the character
you want to use to force your input  to  be  packetized  and
queued  for  transmission.  You can enter the code in either
hexadecimal or decimal numbers.

Use default SENDPAC value $0D for ordinary conversation with
CR ON to send packets  at  natural  intervals  with  <<CR>s>
included in the packet.

When you are setting CPACTIME ON,  set SENDPAC to some value
not ordinarily used  (say,  <CTRL-A>,  with  CR  OFF).  This
setting  forces  packets  to  be  sent  without  extra  <CR>
characters being sent in the text.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    SLOTTIME n
Mnemonic  :    SL
Default   :    10

Parameter :    n    0 to 250 specifies the time interval
                    during which the TNC waits between
                    generating random numbers to see if it
                    can transmit.

Refer to  :    PERSIST, PPERSIST
------------------------------------------------------------
The SLOTTIME command works with  the  PPERSIST  and  PERSIST
command  to  achieve  true  p-persistent CSMA (Carrier Sense
Multiple  Access)  in  KISS  TNC  mode  and   normal   AX.25
operation.  No real advantage,  however,  is obtained during
AX.25 operation unless other  stations on  the  channel  are
also using PERSIST and SLOTTIME.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    START n
Mnemonic  :    STA
Default   :    $11 <CTRL-Q>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII characters code.

Refer to  :    STOP, XFLOW, TRFLOW, XOFF, XON, RSFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
Use the START command to choose the User Start character you
want  to  use to restart output from the TNC to the terminal
after you have halted it by typing the User Stop character.

NOTES:

1) The User Stop character is set by the STOP command.

2) You can enter the value in either hex or decimal

If the User Start and User Stop characters are set  to  $00,
software  flow control to the TNC is disabled;  the TNC will
only respond to hardware flow control (CTS/RTS).

If the same character is used for both the  User  Start  and
User  Stop characters,  the TNC alternately starts and stops
transmission on receipt of the character ("toggles").


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    STOP n
Mnemonic  :    STO
Default   :    $13 <CTRL-S>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 to 127 decimal) specifies an
                    ASCII character code.

Refer to  :    START, XFLOW, TRFLOW, XOFF, XON, RSFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
Use the STOP command to select the User Stop  character  you
want  to  use  to  stop output from the TNC to the terminal.
Type this character to halt the TNC's output to your monitor
so that you can read the received text before it scrolls off
your screen display.

NOTES:

1) Output is restarted with the User Start character.

2) The User Start character is set by the START command.

3) You can enter the value in either hex or decimal.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    STREAMSW n
Mnemonic  :    STR
Default   :    $01 <CTRL-A>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 to 255) specifies an ASCII
                    character code.

Refer to  :    CSTATUS, USERS, STREAMCA, STREAMDB, LCSTREAM
------------------------------------------------------------
STREAMSW selects the characters used by both the TNC and the
user  to  show  that  a  new  connection  channel  is  being
addressed.

The  character  can  be  PASSed  in the Converse Mode.  This
character is always  ignored  as  a  user-initiated  channel
switch  in  the  Transparent Mode;  it just flows through as
data.

NOTES:

1) You cannot change the outgoing channel while the  TNC  is
active or "on-line" in the Transparent Mode.

2)  To  switch channels,  ESCAPE to the Command Mode.   Then
enter the Converse Mode to use the STREAMSW command.

Refer to STREAMCA for further use of STREAMSW.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    STREAMCA ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    STREMC
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Call sign of the other station is
                    displayed in multiple connection
                    operation.

               OFF  Call sign of the other station is not
                    displayed.

Refer to  :    CSTATUS, USERS, STREAMSW, STREAMDB
------------------------------------------------------------
STREAMCA  displays  the  call  sign  on  the  "connected-to"
station after the channel identifier.

Set   STREAMCA   ON   if  you  intend  to  operate  multiple
connections (as  opposed  to  having  your  "host"  computer
operated multiple connections).

STREAMCA  is  especially  useful when you are operating with
multiple connections.   Using STREAMCA is similar  to  using
MRPT  to  show  digipeater paths when you are monitoring the
channel.

EXAMPLES:

1) When STREAMCA is OFF,  the monitored activity looks  like
this:

:A hi bob
hi ted how goes it?
:B *** CONNECTED to W6YEY
:B must be a dx record.
:A unreal ted
:B big band opening

2)  When  STREAMCA  is ON,  the same activity looks like the
following.

:A: W6UOU: hi bob
hi ted how goes it?
:B: W6YEY:*** CONNECTED to W6YEY
:B: must be a dx record.
:A: unreal ted
:B: W6YEY:big band opening

With STREAMCA ON, ":A" becomes ":A:<call sign>:"


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    STREAMDB ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    STREAMD
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Received STREAMSW characters appear
                    twice (doubled).

               OFF  Received STREAMSW characters appear
                    once (not doubled).

Refer to  :    CSTATUS, USERS, STREAMSW, STREAMCA, LCSTREAM
------------------------------------------------------------
STREAMDB displays received  STREAMSW  characters  as  double
characters.

In the following example, STREAMDB is ON and STREAMSW is set
to "|":

|| this is a test.

The sending station actually transmitted:

| this is a test.

The same frame received with STREAMDB OFF would be displayed
as:

| this is a test.

NOTE:  Set  STREAMDB  ON  when  you  operate  with  multiple
connections so you can tell the deference  between  STREAMSW
characters  received  from  the  other stations and STREAMSW
characters generated by your TNC.

NOTE: STREAMSW characters must not be  one  of  the  channel
numbers (A through K) for this command to function properly.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TRANS
Mnemonic  :    T
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    COMMAND, CMDTIME, CONVERSE
------------------------------------------------------------
TRANS is an immediate command that switches the TNC from the
Command  Mode to the Transparent Mode.  The current state of
the radio link is  not affected.

Transparent    mode  is  primarily   useful   for   computer
communications.  In the Transparent Mode,  "human interface"
features such as input editing, echoing of input characters,
and type-in flow control are disabled.

Use the Transparent Mode when you need to transfer binary or
other non-text files.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TRACE ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    TRAC
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Trace function is activated.

               OFF  Trace function is disabled.

Refer to  :    none
------------------------------------------------------------
The TRACE command activates the AX.25 protocol  display.  If
TRACE  is  ON,  all  received  frames are displayed in their
entirety, including all header information.

NOTE: Be careful when you use mnemonic - do not use "TRA"!
TRA cause the Controller to change to the Transparent Mode.

The TRACE display is shown as it  appears  on  an  80-column
display.  The following monitored frame is a sample:

W2XYZ* > TESTER <UI>:

Byte              Hex                    Shifted ASCII
====              ===                    =============
000: AA88AA6A8 8AA460AE 6494AA0 406103F0 TESTERoW2XYZ

ASCII
=====
o.x  .....`d...@a..

The  byte  column  shows  the  offset into the packet of the
beginning byte of the line.

The hex display column  shows  the  next  16  bytes  of  the
packet,  exactly as received,  in standard hex format.   The
shifted ASCII column decodes the high-order  seven  bits  of
each bytes as an ASCII character code.

The  ASCII  column  decodes the low-order seven bits of each
bytes as an ASCII character code.

In standard AX.25 packet:

1) The call sign address field is displayed correctly in the
ASCII column.

2) A text  message  is  displayed  correctly  in  the  ASCII
column.

3)   Non-Printing  characters  and  control  characters  are
displayed in both ASCII fields as period (".").

You can examine the hex display field to see the contents of
the SSID byte and the control bytes used by the protocol.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TRFLOW ON/FF
Mnemonic  :    TRF
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Software flow control for the computer
                    or terminal can be activated in
                    the Transparent Mode.

               OFF  Software flow control for the computer
                    or terminal is disabled in the
                    Transparent Mode.

Refer to  :    START, STOP, XFLOW, TXFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
If TRFLOW is ON,  the type  of  flow  control  used  in  the
Transparent  Mode  is  determined  by how START and STOP are
set.

If TRFLOW is OFF, only "hardware" flow control (CTS, RTS) is
available to the computer and all characters received by the
TNC are transmitted as data.

If START and STOP are set to $00,  the user  Stop  and  User
Start  characters  are disabled - hardware flow control must
be used by the computer.

If TRFLOW is ON,  and START and STOP are set to values other
than  zero,  software flow control is enabled for the user's
computer or terminal.   The TNc responds to the  User  Start
and  User  Stop  characters  (set  by  START and STOP) while
remaining transparent  to  all  other  characters  from  the
terminal.

Unless  TXFLOW  is  also  ON<  only hardware flow control is
available to the TNc to control output from the terminal.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TRIES n
Mnemonic  :    TRI
Default   :    0

Parameter :    n    0 to 15 specifies the current RETRY
                    level on the selected input channel.

Refer to  :    RETRY
------------------------------------------------------------
TRIES retrieves (or forces) the count of "tries" on the data
channel presently selected.

If you type tries without an argument,  the TNC returns  the
current  number  of  tries  if an outstanding unacknowledged
frame exists. If no outstanding unacknowledged frame exists,
the TNC returns the number of tries required to get  an  ACK
for the previous frame.

If RETRY is set to zero(0), the TRIES command always returns
zero.

Use  TRIES  for  gathering  statistics  on  a  given path or
channel.  TRIES is especially useful  for  computer-operated
stations  (such  as  automatic  message-forwarding stations)
using less-than-optimal, noise  HF or satellite channels or
paths.

Using TRIES under these conditions automatically   optimized
the PACLEN and MAXFRAME parameters.

If  you type TRIES with an argument,  the 'tries' counter is
forced to the entered value.  Using this command to force  a
new count of tries is not recommended.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TXDELAY n
Mnemonic  :    TX
Default   :    50 (500ms)

Parameter :    n    0 to 120 specifies 10 mS intervals.

Refer to  :    AXDELAY, AXHANG
------------------------------------------------------------
The  TXDELAY  command  tells the TNC how long to wait before
sending packet frame data after  keying  your  transmitter's
PTT line.

All  transmitters need some amount of start-up time to put a
signal on the air; some need more, some need less.

Some general rules apply to these:

1) Crystal-controlled radios with the diode T/R switches are
faster

2) Synthesizer radios need time for phase-lock-loop to lock.

3) Radios with mechanical transmit  /receive    relays  need
more time.

4)  External  amplifiers  that use RF-driven relay switching
usually require you to increase TXDELAY  to  allow  for  the
additional delays.

Experiment  to  determine  the  best  TXDELAY  value  for  a
specific radio.

TXDELAY can also compensate for certain  characteristics  of
the  radio  used  by the station which you are communicating
with.

If the distant station's radio  has  slow  AGC  recovery  or
squelch  release times when it is switching from transmit to
receive,  increasing your TXDELAY  may  reduce  retries  and
improve throughput by retarding the start of your data until
the other receiver has reached full sensitivity.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    TXFLOW ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    TXF
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Software flow  control for the TNC can
                    be activated in the Transparent Mode.

               OFF  Software control for the TNC is disabled
                    in the Transparent Mode.

Refer to  :    XON, XOFF, XFLOW, TRFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
When TXFLOW is ON,  the setting of XFLOW determines the type
of flow control used in Transparent mode.

When TXFLOW is OFF, the TNC uses only hardware flow control;
all data sent to the terminal remains fully transparent.

When TXFLOW and XFLOW are ON,  the TNC uses  the  Start  and
Stop  characters ( set by XON and XOFF) to control the input
from the terminal.

Unless TRFLOW is also ON,  only  hardware  flow  control  is
available to the computer or terminal to control output from
the TNC.

------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    UNPROTO call1[VIA call2[,call3...,call9]]
Mnemonic  :    U
Default   :    CQ

Parameter :    Call1     Call sign to be placed in the TO
                         address field.

               Call2-9   Optional digipeater call  list,  up
to
                         eight calls.

Refer to  :    CONNECT
------------------------------------------------------------
UNPROTO  sets the digipeat and destination address fields or
packets sent in the unconnected (unprotocol) mode.

Unconnected packets are sent as  un-sequenced  I-frame  with
the  destination  and  digipeat  fields  taken  from "call1"
through  "call9"  options.     When  a  destination  is  not
specified, unconnected packets are sent to "CQ".

You can monitor unconnected packets sent from other packet
stations by setting MONITOR ON.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    USERS n
Mnemonic  :    US
Default   :    1

Parameter :    n    0 to 10 specifies the number of active
                    simultaneous connections that can be
                    established with your TNC.

Refer to  :    STREAMSW
------------------------------------------------------------
USERS  only  affects  the way that incoming connect requests
are handled.  It does not affect the number  of  connections
you initiate with your TNC.  For example:

USERS 0   Allows  incoming  connections  on any free logical
channel.

USERS 1   Allows incoming connections on logical  channel  0
only.

USERS 2   Allows  incoming  connections on logical channel 0
and 1.

USERS 3   Allows incoming connections on logical channel  0,
1 and 2, and so on, through USERS 10.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    WRITE
Mnemonic  :    W
Default   :    Immediate Command

Parameter :    none

Refer to  :    "Using the Bulletin Board Feature" in the
               Operating Instruction Manual.
------------------------------------------------------------
WRITE command write a file or message to BBS.




------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    XFLOW ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    X
Default   :    ON

Parameter :    ON   XON/XOFF (software) flow control is
                    activated.

               OFF  XON/XOFF flow control is disabled -
                    hardware control is enabled.

Refer to  :    TRFLOW, TXFLOW, START, STOP, XON, XOFF,
               FLOVER, RSFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
When XFLOW is ON,  software flow control is in effect; it is
assumed that the computer or terminal will  respond  to  the
TNC's  start and stop characters defined by the XON and XOFF
commands.

When XFLOW is  OFF,  the  TNc  uses  hardware  flow  control
command on the CTS  and RTS line.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    XMITOK ON/OFF
Mnemonic  :    XMITO
Default   :    OFF

Parameter :    ON   Transmit functions (PTT line) are
                    active.

               OFF  Transmit functions (PTT line) are
                    disabled.

Refer to  :    CONOK, DIGIPEAT, MYCALL
------------------------------------------------------------
When  XMITOK  is  OFF,  the  PTT line to your transmitter is
disabled; the transmit function is inhibited.  All other TNC
functions  remain  the  same.   Your TNC generates and sends
packets as requested, but does not key the radio's PTT line.

Use the XMITOK command at any time to ensure that  your  TNC
does not transmit.

Set  XMITOK OFF if you are absent and wish to leave your TNC
on as a channel activity monitor.

Set XMITOK OFF  for  testing  in  loopback  or  direct  wire
connections when PTT operation is not required.



------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    XOFF n
Mnemonic  :    XO
Default   :    $13 <CTRL-S>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F ( 0 to 127 decimal) specifies
                    and ASCII code.

Refer to  :    START, STOP, XFLOW, XON, TXFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
Use  XOFF  to  select  the stop character to be used to stop
input from the computer or terminal.

You can enter the code in either hex or decimal.


NOTE: You can entire the code in either hex or decimal.

The Start character default value is <CTRL-Q>  for  computer
data transfers.

If  you  are  operating  in the Converse Mode and there is a
chance that activity might fill the TNC's buffers,  you  can
define  the Stop character as <CTRL-G> ($07),  which "beeps"
many terminals.


------------------------------------------------------------
Command   :    XON n
Mnemonic  :    XON
Default   :    $11 <CTRL-Q>

Parameter :    n    0 to $7F (0 through 127 decimal)
                    specifies an  ASCII character code.

Refer to:START, STOP, XFLOW, XOFF, TXFLOW
------------------------------------------------------------
XON selects the TNC start character  that  is  sent  to  the
computer or terminal to restart input from the device.

NOTE: You can entire the code in either hex or decimal.

The  Start  character default value is <CTRL-Q> for computer
data transfers.

If you are operating in the Converse Mode  and  there  is  a
chance  that activity might fill the TNC's buffers,  you can
define the Stop character as <CTRL-G> ($07),  which  "beeps"
many terminals.
